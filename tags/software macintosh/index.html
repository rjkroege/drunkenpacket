        <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The packet wanted to change the size of an image.  (You might notice<br>the result in a previous post.)  As always, we over-complicated the<br>task.  You see, rather than settling for just any editor, we here<br>at drunkenpacket wanted an image editor that was <em>satisfying</em>.</p>
<p>So, we tried some out.  And will give you the benefit of our opinion.<br>Even though you didn&#39;t ask.  The basis of comparison was some sort<br>of non-objective sense of <em>snappiness</em> and responsiveness of dragging<br>a selected segment of an image.  The image in question was chosen<br>to be representative of what would be produced by a reasonable mid-range<br>digital camera: a 2304 by 3456 pixel JPEG.  (No, we&#39;ll not show you<br>the image.  Use your imagination.)</p>
<p>We selected a large chunk of it, made this a new layer and panned<br>around the image at full size as one might be wont to do when looking<br>for all of the dust particles thoughtfully included by the scanner.</p>
<h1>The Candidates</h1>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/" target="_blank">Pixelmator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nolobe.com/iris/" target="_blank">Iris</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/" target="_blank">Acorn</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There has been (relatively recently) a spate of new Macintosh image<br>editors.  Others have written serious reviews of them.  This is not<br>a serious review.  But it might suggest some novel alternatives.</p>
<h2>Imagewell</h2>
<p>We had previously used a free version of Imagewell for all our<br>blog-related image twiddling. (Like removing the parts we didn&#39;t<br>want you see.  No, not the naughty bits. More like our thumbs bulging<br>enormously into the phone camera frame.)</p>
<p>Imagewell does what we need for DP image processing: some simple<br>pan, resize, crop etc. Except that it use to be free and now it<br>isn&#39;t.  The packet finds himself oddly annoyed by this sort of<br>infinite inflation. So, we skipped it.</p>
<h2>Pixelmator</h2>
<p>The packet noted how the marketing contents for Pixelmator make<br>prominent use of supermodels (or at least young women pretending<br>to be) in its sample screen shots.  This sums up everything wrong<br>with Pixelmator.  It&#39;s all about looking beautiful and not necessarily<br>about being particularly useful.</p>
<p>In our simple test, while dragging a rectangular layer proceeded<br>smoothly,  (That would be CoreGraphics for you perhaps.) the non-rectangular selection<br>drag chugged along.  The packet refuses to pay for image processing<br>software today that is not as fast as MacPaint on his Mac SE.</p>
<p>Purists may blither on about how this is an unfair comparison: the<br>image of today is at least 4bytes/pixel instead of 1b.   Pish posh:<br>Core duo 2 can sustain around 8 billion instructions/second vs the<br>68000&#39;s paltry 4 million and I have a GPU.  My drags should go fast.  Always.</p>
<h2>Iris</h2>
<p>We were tired and wanted more coffee so we looked at the website,<br>said <em>isn&#39;t that nice</em> and closed the window.</p>
<h2>Acorn</h2>
<p>We so wanted to like Acorn. It has such a rational interface compared<br>to Pixelmator.  The author has really tried to build a better paint<br>program.  In terms of usability, Acorn is the best.  One can even<br>write plugins (in Python no less and the reader already knows that<br>the packet has a fondness for snakes.)</p>
<p>Only one thingâ€¦ Acorn was slower than Pixelmator.  The end of a<br>drag left the CPU meter pegged at a 100% for at least 5 seconds.</p>
<h2>Shake</h2>
<p>We&#39;ll talk about using Shake as a paint program again. And have<br>before.  Shake is way more powerful than all of these other programs.<br>It drags the layers plenty fast.  But even the packet in a dervish<br>fit of quixotic tool taste would be willing to admit that it is the<br>one package here that <em>doesn&#39;t fit with the others.</em>  It would take<br>longer for the packet to remember how to import an image into Shake<br>than the the entire task would take in a more normal piece of<br>software.</p>
<h2>Seashore</h2>
<p>We had looked at Seashore before. The website does not impress.<br>The previous version of the software had seemed, well, sparse.<br>(Especially after the baroque glitz of Pixelmator.)</p>
<p>But hey, the packet is open minded. Sometimes.</p>
<p>Seashore is open source.  Free/Libre is good on financial and<br>ideological grounds.  And it&#39;s not too shabby looking either.  And<br>fast enough. Faster than the others.  Image drags were smooth.  Hmm.<br>Perhaps there&#39;s something to be said about a strong underlying core<br>image representation as a set of tiles?  Perhaps the packet should<br>contribute.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Seashore for our blog-related image fix-ups.  And maybe we&#39;ll get out<br>our coding beach towel.  </p>
