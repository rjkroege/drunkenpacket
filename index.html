I have finished the first version of my Chrome extension for posting <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_blank">pinboard.in</a> bookrmarks from the Chrome omnibox.

        <div class='post_body'><p>Oh devoted readers, you will recall from earlier that I was bemoaning the possible end of delicious. And my waxing cassandra on the matter. Eventually, I decided to use Google bookmarks. I have revisited my choices. I was finding Google bookmarks tedious. Besides, I wanted something different. So, I have done what I should have done in the first place and am now using <a href="pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>.</p><br><br><p>This has required some integration with my web-browsing work-flow. (I shudder at the thought of calling it <em>work-flow</em> given that it is largely web-browsing born out of the stultifying boredom of being confined to bed. But <em>idle-flow</em> doesn&rsquo;t really have the same familiar ring.) I have applied the following:</p><br><br><ul><br><li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geojpngopndpffccbfgekncdgmgchmgh" target="_blank">Pinboard.in Chrome button</a> to make it easy to add bookmarks. (I tried some others but this one worked the best for me.)</p></li><br><li><p>Searching my pinboard bookmarks from the Chrome omnibox as per <a href="http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/how-to-add-pinboardin-search-mine-as-a-chrome" target="_blank">Add Pinboard to &lsquo;Search Mine&rsquo;</a></p></li><br></ul><br><br><p>But this leaves two issues which I&rsquo;d like to rectify:</p><br><br><ul><br><li><p>Add a bookmark from the omnibox via command. I can type the name of the bookmarklet but it requires an extra keystroke (down arrow) for Chrome to not try searching for the bookmarklet name on Google. The extra keystroke is clearly too much effort for flowing idly.</p></li><br><li><p>Slurp the pinboard bookmarks into Chrome&rsquo;s bookmarks automatically so that omnibox searches go to the pinboard bookmarks too.</p></li><br></ul><br><br><p>For both of these, I think I will need to write Chrome extensions. You should anticipate these also appearing on my github once I think they actually work.</p></div>

        <div class='post_body'><p>The packet is undergoing maintenance. It&rsquo;s sad but true. Some fractured bones have limited the packet&rsquo;s mobility, quality of life, etc. It makes exploring the alleyways of the physical world more difficult. Conversely, it has provided the packet with more time to explore the alleyways of the internet. And catch up on his reading. And possibly his blogging as well.</p><br><br><p>My small but devoted audience may recall that earlier, I had started noting books that friends had leant me and was beginning to comment on them. I will continue this now that I have finished some more.</p><br><br><h1>Rule of Four</h1><br><br><p>This book is a mystery novel about a pair of university students obsessed with the secret of an ancient book and their conflict with their advisors, peers and friends over their obsession. I found the book readable but tedious. Tedious in large part because the narrator sacrificed a wonderful romantic relationship for his obsession. Maybe the packet&rsquo;s subconscious found this a little too personally relevant</p><br><br><h1>The Science of God</h1><br><br><p>This book makes a convoluted attempt to show that modern science (particularly cosmology and biological differentiation) is compatible with a literal interpretation of the bible. I cannot understand why someone would feel the need to engage in so much (quality) scholarship for such an unnecessary task. It <em>doesn&rsquo;t matter</em> if a literal interpretation of the bible is incompatible with scientific thought: religious adherents, must, to be religious, believe in the unprovable. Belief in the absence of evidence is both the challenge and the reward (perhaps I&rsquo;ll expand on this in a future article.) And once one has enough belief to be a believer, one can simply <em>believe</em> that the bible is literally true while simultaneously choosing to understand the objective corporeal world via scientific insights.</p><br><br><h1>The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife</h1><br><br><p>I have trouble with this book. It&rsquo;s so sad. So evocative of complex emotional issues. So much opportunity to introspect with the characters as they interact at different ages and understand the tragedy of their endless separation. I had to stop. Something lighter with explosions was necessary.</p></div>

        <div class='post_body'><p>The packet is fickle: always I am willing to switch to a new<br>development workflow. Definitely if it&rsquo;s better. Or even if it&rsquo;s just<br>different. Lately, I have been exploring use of<br><a href="http://macromates.com/" target="_blank">TextMate</a>.  I use to use (and maintain my own<br>version of) <a href="http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/wily/" target="_blank">wily</a> but given that a<br>a three button mouse is mandatory to efficient use, it is a challenge<br>to use on planes, trains, etc. Other posts will expand on my editor<br>angst &mdash; Acme vs Wily and the absence of source highlighting for<br>example. But this is sufficient background for the now.</p><br><br><p>Anyway, back to TextMate. It has a lovely bundle scheme that permits<br>defining all kinds of interesting new features. I am please to have<br>completed my first new command. It is tiny and needs other components.<br>A small step. But maybe useful. The packet has been working on WebKit.<br>And <a href="http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch?vert=chromium" target="_blank">Google CodeSearch</a><br>has ever so nicely decided to index WebKit&rsquo;s source code. So, I made a<br>codesearch command:</p><br><br><div class="CodeRay"><br>  <div class="code"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/rc<br>if ( ~ $TM_SELECTED_TEXT ()) {<br>    # this is one big URL with a single var injected.<br>    open &#39;<a href="http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch?as_q=&#39;\" target="_blank">http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch?as_q=&#39;\</a><br>    ^$TM_CURRENT_WORD^\<br>    &#39;&amp;btnG=Search+Code&amp;hl=en&amp;vert=chromium&amp;\<br>    filesuggest=&amp;as_lang=&amp;as_filename=&amp;as_class=&amp;\<br>    as_function=&amp;as_case=&#39;<br>} else {<br>    # this is one big URL with a single var injected.<br>    open &#39;<a href="http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch?as_q=&#39;\" target="_blank">http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch?as_q=&#39;\</a><br>    ^$TM_SELECTED_TEXT^\<br>    &#39;&amp;btnG=Search+Code&amp;hl=en&amp;vert=chromium&amp;\<br>    filesuggest=&amp;as_lang=&amp;as_filename=&amp;as_class=&amp;\<br>    as_function=&amp;as_case=&#39;<br>}</pre></div><br></div>


<p>with input being <em>Selected Text</em> or <em>Scope</em> (Is this right?), bound to<br>^/. And presto! I can ^/ on a type name and look it up. Extra handy<br>this is in WebKit given the paucity of comments. (They make you weak<br>don&rsquo;t you know.)</p>

<p>All this material is however merely prelude to the main event. We have<br>a one-directional link here: from TextMate to CodeSearch. What about<br>the other side?  That will be more interesting. My general approach<br>will be as follows:</p>

<p><ul></p>
<p><li><p>Create textmate URL scheme links in the output of CodeSearch for<br>everything that I could imagine clicking on that would take me back to<br>TextMate.  This I can do via a Chrome extension.  The details will<br>appear here. Soonish. (And if you follow this blog, you&rsquo;ll know what<br>kind of precision is associated with this time estimate.)</p></li></p>
<p><li><p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/mbhutton/chrome-duplicate-tab-detector" target="_blank">chrome-duplicate-tab-detector</a><br>extension to stop tab-itis from expanding for each search. (Or is it<br>feature to have lots?) Maybe it&rsquo;s a feature.</p></li><br></ul></div></p>

        <p>It has become a bit of a recurring meme to take photos of food. Many<br>times, food is indeed plated in a fashion that is at least creative if<br>not actual art.</p>
<p>This begs the question: what makes for photogenic food? The steam? The<br>color? Does comfort food look better or worse than la nouvelle<br>cuisine? Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
