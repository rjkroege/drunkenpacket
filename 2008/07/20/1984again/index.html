        <p>Some of you may remember 1984.  Not the movie but Macintosh.  As far as a computer geeks go,<br>that was the event in the year.  It took a while for me to touch the machine personally.  I still remember<br>the moment.  I was a poor college student living in Tokyo back then.</p>
<p>In an afternoon of the day, I stopped by a showroom of a major computer dealer in Tokyo downtown<br>(precisely say, Takatano Baba).  It was sitting quietly without drawing much attention from visitors.<br>It had to be a dream machine, since that was conceived by two Steves of Apple (well, I believed that<br>way at the moment).  Once I started playing with the machine, it was breathtaking.  I could not believe<br>how far the machine gone to.  I felt like I had been living in a dark age.  And this was the light for the<br>future.</p>

<p>Macintosh has created our future in some sense.  On the other hand, Macintosh is currently neither<br>dominating PC market nor anything closer.  Microsoft launched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0" target="_blank">Windows ver 1.0</a> in 1985.<br>The product was not anywhere near Macintosh.  I could not believe how primitive it was.  It was like a<br>small project done by a summer intern.  Around 1986, Macintosh sales were taking off.  Apple had a<br>great success.  Many had believed that Apple would enjoy the success long time.</p>
<p>Microsoft launched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0" target="_blank">Windows ver 3</a> in 1990 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x" target="_blank">ver 3.1</a> in 1992.  Macintosh was still<br>technically ahead of them.  However, Microsoft was seeing a strong sales growth as they were persistent.<br>Then, Microsoft released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95" target="_blank">Windows 95</a> in 1995.  It was the time that Netscape (founded in 1994)<br>was changing the world by introducing the web to the world.  Windows 95 sales took off with a huge<br>demand for Internet terminal.  Windows 95 was the choice for most.  Apple had gradually lost their sales.<br>They had a major business crisis in 1997.  Though they could have died then, Steve Jobs comes back and<br>miraclously they have survived.</p>
<p>In 2007 Apple has released iPhone.  The iPhone has been sold in a brisk pace.  As several experts points<br>out, this is not yet another cell phone.  This is an another breakthrough.  Cell phones have been around<br>for a while.  Gradually we realized that this could be a great computing device.  Some attempts were<br>made without much success.  It seems that the iPhone is changing the picture.  Ok, the sales is pretty<br>good.  But what does make it a breakthrough?</p>
<p>Apple introduced iPhone 3G this month.  Simultaneously it has released version 2.0 firmware that allows<br>developers to write code for the device officially.  This year‘s WWDC (Apple’s developer&#39;s conference)<br>had a record number of developers (sold out first time ever since 1983 when a first WWDC was held in<br>Monterey, CA).  Obviously many new developers were drawn by iPhone.  For whatever reason, many<br>developers want to do their business on it.  That is very critical for a platform business.  I think this is<br>one good indication for their success.  I have not seen any other mobile phone attracting this many<br>application developers.</p>
<p>Maybe Apple has made an another major leap by iPhone.  The ambience around the device reminds me<br>1984.  That is very exciting.  On the other hand, we know the rest of the history.  I have to wonder what<br>we are going to remember in ten years.  I strongly hope that “2007 won&#39;t be like 1984”.  Still they are<br>not the only player in town.  I am going to write some interesting observations of the mobile computing<br>platform later.</p>
