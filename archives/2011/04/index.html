        <div class='post_body'><p>Oh devoted readers, you will recall from earlier that I was bemoaning the possible end of delicious. And my waxing cassandra on the matter. Eventually, I decided to use Google bookmarks. I have revisited my choices. I was finding Google bookmarks tedious. Besides, I wanted something different. So, I have done what I should have done in the first place and am now using <a href="pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>.</p><br><br><p>This has required some integration with my web-browsing work-flow. (I shudder at the thought of calling it <em>work-flow</em> given that it is largely web-browsing born out of the stultifying boredom of being confined to bed. But <em>idle-flow</em> doesn&rsquo;t really have the same familiar ring.) I have applied the following:</p><br><br><ul><br><li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geojpngopndpffccbfgekncdgmgchmgh" target="_blank">Pinboard.in Chrome button</a> to make it easy to add bookmarks. (I tried some others but this one worked the best for me.)</p></li><br><li><p>Searching my pinboard bookmarks from the Chrome omnibox as per <a href="http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/how-to-add-pinboardin-search-mine-as-a-chrome" target="_blank">Add Pinboard to &lsquo;Search Mine&rsquo;</a></p></li><br></ul><br><br><p>But this leaves two issues which I&rsquo;d like to rectify:</p><br><br><ul><br><li><p>Add a bookmark from the omnibox via command. I can type the name of the bookmarklet but it requires an extra keystroke (down arrow) for Chrome to not try searching for the bookmarklet name on Google. The extra keystroke is clearly too much effort for flowing idly.</p></li><br><li><p>Slurp the pinboard bookmarks into Chrome&rsquo;s bookmarks automatically so that omnibox searches go to the pinboard bookmarks too.</p></li><br></ul><br><br><p>For both of these, I think I will need to write Chrome extensions. You should anticipate these also appearing on my github once I think they actually work.</p></div>

        <div class='post_body'><p>The packet is undergoing maintenance. It&rsquo;s sad but true. Some fractured bones have limited the packet&rsquo;s mobility, quality of life, etc. It makes exploring the alleyways of the physical world more difficult. Conversely, it has provided the packet with more time to explore the alleyways of the internet. And catch up on his reading. And possibly his blogging as well.</p><br><br><p>My small but devoted audience may recall that earlier, I had started noting books that friends had leant me and was beginning to comment on them. I will continue this now that I have finished some more.</p><br><br><h1>Rule of Four</h1><br><br><p>This book is a mystery novel about a pair of university students obsessed with the secret of an ancient book and their conflict with their advisors, peers and friends over their obsession. I found the book readable but tedious. Tedious in large part because the narrator sacrificed a wonderful romantic relationship for his obsession. Maybe the packet&rsquo;s subconscious found this a little too personally relevant</p><br><br><h1>The Science of God</h1><br><br><p>This book makes a convoluted attempt to show that modern science (particularly cosmology and biological differentiation) is compatible with a literal interpretation of the bible. I cannot understand why someone would feel the need to engage in so much (quality) scholarship for such an unnecessary task. It <em>doesn&rsquo;t matter</em> if a literal interpretation of the bible is incompatible with scientific thought: religious adherents, must, to be religious, believe in the unprovable. Belief in the absence of evidence is both the challenge and the reward (perhaps I&rsquo;ll expand on this in a future article.) And once one has enough belief to be a believer, one can simply <em>believe</em> that the bible is literally true while simultaneously choosing to understand the objective corporeal world via scientific insights.</p><br><br><h1>The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife</h1><br><br><p>I have trouble with this book. It&rsquo;s so sad. So evocative of complex emotional issues. So much opportunity to introspect with the characters as they interact at different ages and understand the tragedy of their endless separation. I had to stop. Something lighter with explosions was necessary.</p></div>

<p>Dinner for two nights. Cabbage with miso sauce: I stir-fried cabbage<br>with tinned fish, discarded the onion because it had withered up and<br>added miso sauce: siracha, miso, rice vinegar, ginger. With a picture<br>because I mentioned food photos.</p>

Some comments about them are in order. <p>First finished book: World War Z. I would pronounce the last letter zed though I suppose the name has more humour as zee rhyming with three. What a strange saga. The zombies need a why. In particular how they resist rotting. Still, I was entertained.</p></div>
