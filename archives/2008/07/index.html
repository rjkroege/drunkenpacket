        <p>Some of you may remember 1984.  Not the movie but Macintosh.  As far as a computer geeks go,<br>that was the event in the year.  It took a while for me to touch the machine personally.  I still remember<br>the moment.  I was a poor college student living in Tokyo back then.</p>
<p>In an afternoon of the day, I stopped by a showroom of a major computer dealer in Tokyo downtown<br>(precisely say, Takatano Baba).  It was sitting quietly without drawing much attention from visitors.<br>It had to be a dream machine, since that was conceived by two Steves of Apple (well, I believed that<br>way at the moment).  Once I started playing with the machine, it was breathtaking.  I could not believe<br>how far the machine gone to.  I felt like I had been living in a dark age.  And this was the light for the<br>future.</p>

<p>Macintosh has created our future in some sense.  On the other hand, Macintosh is currently neither<br>dominating PC market nor anything closer.  Microsoft launched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0" target="_blank">Windows ver 1.0</a> in 1985.<br>The product was not anywhere near Macintosh.  I could not believe how primitive it was.  It was like a<br>small project done by a summer intern.  Around 1986, Macintosh sales were taking off.  Apple had a<br>great success.  Many had believed that Apple would enjoy the success long time.</p>
<p>Microsoft launched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0" target="_blank">Windows ver 3</a> in 1990 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x" target="_blank">ver 3.1</a> in 1992.  Macintosh was still<br>technically ahead of them.  However, Microsoft was seeing a strong sales growth as they were persistent.<br>Then, Microsoft released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95" target="_blank">Windows 95</a> in 1995.  It was the time that Netscape (founded in 1994)<br>was changing the world by introducing the web to the world.  Windows 95 sales took off with a huge<br>demand for Internet terminal.  Windows 95 was the choice for most.  Apple had gradually lost their sales.<br>They had a major business crisis in 1997.  Though they could have died then, Steve Jobs comes back and<br>miraclously they have survived.</p>
<p>In 2007 Apple has released iPhone.  The iPhone has been sold in a brisk pace.  As several experts points<br>out, this is not yet another cell phone.  This is an another breakthrough.  Cell phones have been around<br>for a while.  Gradually we realized that this could be a great computing device.  Some attempts were<br>made without much success.  It seems that the iPhone is changing the picture.  Ok, the sales is pretty<br>good.  But what does make it a breakthrough?</p>
<p>Apple introduced iPhone 3G this month.  Simultaneously it has released version 2.0 firmware that allows<br>developers to write code for the device officially.  This year‘s WWDC (Apple’s developer&#39;s conference)<br>had a record number of developers (sold out first time ever since 1983 when a first WWDC was held in<br>Monterey, CA).  Obviously many new developers were drawn by iPhone.  For whatever reason, many<br>developers want to do their business on it.  That is very critical for a platform business.  I think this is<br>one good indication for their success.  I have not seen any other mobile phone attracting this many<br>application developers.</p>
<p>Maybe Apple has made an another major leap by iPhone.  The ambience around the device reminds me<br>1984.  That is very exciting.  On the other hand, we know the rest of the history.  I have to wonder what<br>we are going to remember in ten years.  I strongly hope that “2007 won&#39;t be like 1984”.  Still they are<br>not the only player in town.  I am going to write some interesting observations of the mobile computing<br>platform later.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The packet wanted to change the size of an image.  (You might notice<br>the result in a previous post.)  As always, we over-complicated the<br>task.  You see, rather than settling for just any editor, we here<br>at drunkenpacket wanted an image editor that was <em>satisfying</em>.</p>
<p>So, we tried some out.  And will give you the benefit of our opinion.<br>Even though you didn&#39;t ask.  The basis of comparison was some sort<br>of non-objective sense of <em>snappiness</em> and responsiveness of dragging<br>a selected segment of an image.  The image in question was chosen<br>to be representative of what would be produced by a reasonable mid-range<br>digital camera: a 2304 by 3456 pixel JPEG.  (No, we&#39;ll not show you<br>the image.  Use your imagination.)</p>
<p>We selected a large chunk of it, made this a new layer and panned<br>around the image at full size as one might be wont to do when looking<br>for all of the dust particles thoughtfully included by the scanner.</p>
<h1>The Candidates</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://xtralean.com/IWOverview.html" target="_blank">Imagewell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/" target="_blank">Pixelmator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nolobe.com/iris/" target="_blank">Iris</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/" target="_blank">Acorn</a></li>
<li><a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/feature.php" target="_blank">Seashore</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/shake/" target="_blank">Shake</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There has been (relatively recently) a spate of new Macintosh image<br>editors.  Others have written serious reviews of them.  This is not<br>a serious review.  But it might suggest some novel alternatives.</p>
<h2>Imagewell</h2>
<p>We had previously used a free version of Imagewell for all our<br>blog-related image twiddling. (Like removing the parts we didn&#39;t<br>want you see.  No, not the naughty bits. More like our thumbs bulging<br>enormously into the phone camera frame.)</p>
<p>Imagewell does what we need for DP image processing: some simple<br>pan, resize, crop etc. Except that it use to be free and now it<br>isn&#39;t.  The packet finds himself oddly annoyed by this sort of<br>infinite inflation. So, we skipped it.</p>
<h2>Pixelmator</h2>
<p>The packet noted how the marketing contents for Pixelmator make<br>prominent use of supermodels (or at least young women pretending<br>to be) in its sample screen shots.  This sums up everything wrong<br>with Pixelmator.  It&#39;s all about looking beautiful and not necessarily<br>about being particularly useful.</p>
<p>In our simple test, while dragging a rectangular layer proceeded<br>smoothly,  (That would be CoreGraphics for you perhaps.) the non-rectangular selection<br>drag chugged along.  The packet refuses to pay for image processing<br>software today that is not as fast as MacPaint on his Mac SE.</p>
<p>Purists may blither on about how this is an unfair comparison: the<br>image of today is at least 4bytes/pixel instead of 1b.   Pish posh:<br>Core duo 2 can sustain around 8 billion instructions/second vs the<br>68000&#39;s paltry 4 million and I have a GPU.  My drags should go fast.  Always.</p>
<h2>Iris</h2>
<p>We were tired and wanted more coffee so we looked at the website,<br>said <em>isn&#39;t that nice</em> and closed the window.</p>
<h2>Acorn</h2>
<p>We so wanted to like Acorn. It has such a rational interface compared<br>to Pixelmator.  The author has really tried to build a better paint<br>program.  In terms of usability, Acorn is the best.  One can even<br>write plugins (in Python no less and the reader already knows that<br>the packet has a fondness for snakes.)</p>
<p>Only one thing… Acorn was slower than Pixelmator.  The end of a<br>drag left the CPU meter pegged at a 100% for at least 5 seconds.</p>
<h2>Shake</h2>
<p>We&#39;ll talk about using Shake as a paint program again. And have<br>before.  Shake is way more powerful than all of these other programs.<br>It drags the layers plenty fast.  But even the packet in a dervish<br>fit of quixotic tool taste would be willing to admit that it is the<br>one package here that <em>doesn&#39;t fit with the others.</em>  It would take<br>longer for the packet to remember how to import an image into Shake<br>than the the entire task would take in a more normal piece of<br>software.</p>
<h2>Seashore</h2>
<p>We had looked at Seashore before. The website does not impress.<br>The previous version of the software had seemed, well, sparse.<br>(Especially after the baroque glitz of Pixelmator.)</p>
<p>But hey, the packet is open minded. Sometimes.</p>
<p>Seashore is open source.  Free/Libre is good on financial and<br>ideological grounds.  And it&#39;s not too shabby looking either.  And<br>fast enough. Faster than the others.  Image drags were smooth.  Hmm.<br>Perhaps there&#39;s something to be said about a strong underlying core<br>image representation as a set of tiles?  Perhaps the packet should<br>contribute.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Seashore for our blog-related image fix-ups.  And maybe we&#39;ll get out<br>our coding beach towel.  </p>
